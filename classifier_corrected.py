""" Amazon Access Challenge Starter Code

These files provide some starter code using 
the scikit-learn library. It provides some examples on how
to design a simple algorithm, including pre-processing,
training a logistic regression classifier on the data,
assess its performance through cross-validation and some 
pointers on where to go next.
